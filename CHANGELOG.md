***

## 2.26.1

* [Issue #172](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/172)
  * Fixed: `New-GoogleService` now using `New-Object` to prevent `[Google.Apis.Util.Store.FileDataStore]::new()` constructor issues in PowerShell 4.
* [Issue #173](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/173)
  * Added: `FolderColorRgb` parameter to `New-GSDriveFile` and `Update-GSDriveFile` to enable setting the color of a folder in Drive - _Thanks, [@WJurecki](https://github.com/WJurecki)!_
* [PR #174](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/174) - _Thanks, [@WJurecki](https://github.com/WJurecki)!_
  * Fixed: `Get-GSDriveFileList` filter concatenation so it joins multiple filters with ` and ` instead of just a space ` `.

## 2.26.0

* [Issue #169](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/169)
  * Fixed: `Get-GSGmailMessage` fails to download attachments containing invalid characters (e.g. `:`)
* [Issue #168](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/168)
  * Added: `Add-GSUserLocation`
  * Updated: `New-GSUser` and `Update-GSUser` to add in Location support
* Miscellaneous
  * Improved pipeline support for the `User` parameter across all pertinent functions, i.e. Drive, Calendar, Gmail, Sheets & Tasks APIs.

## 2.25.3

* Miscellaneous
  * Added: Pipeline support for `Remove-GSCalendarEvent`

## 2.25.2

* [Issue #167](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/167)
  * Fixed: `Switch-PSGSuiteConfig -SetToDefault` failing with invalid scope errors

## 2.25.1

* [PR #165](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/165) - _Thanks, [@scv-m](https://github.com/scv-m)!_
  * Updated: `Get-GSCourseParticipant` now supports pipeline input for CourseId to enable piping `Get-GSCourse` into it.
* [Issue #166](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/166)
  * Fixed: `Update-GSUser` would fail to update user phones due to incorrect variable name in the Process block, effectively skipping it.

## 2.25.0

* [Issue #162](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/162)
  * Updated: `New-GoogleService` now caches Service objects created during the current session. This means that repeated calls will attempt to use an existing Service object from the cache if present, otherwise it will create the Service as usual.
  * Updated: `New-GoogleService` Verbose output. To cut down on verbose noisiness, the following verbose output is set:
    * New Service created = `Building ServiceAccountCredential from....`
    * First use of existing Service = `Using matching cached service for user....`
    * Re-use of existing Service = No verbose output (helps cut down on pipeline verbosity where service re-use is expected)
  * Added: `Get-PSGSuiteServiceCache` to get the current Service Cache for inspection.
* [Issue #163](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/163)
  * Added: `Get-GSCalendar` to get the CalendarList of a user.

## 2.24.0

* [Issue #159](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/159)
  * Added: `Revoke-GSStudentGuardianInvitation` to revoke student guardian invitations (Classroom API)

## 2.23.2

* Fixed logic issue with Get-GSUsageReport for reports returning no entities where errors would be thrown. Resolved by guarding against acting on `$null` values in the loop.

## 2.23.1

**This update changes the output of `Get-GSUsageReport` -- please review the output changes before updating if you have scripts that use that function!!**

* Fixed: `Get-GSUsageReport` wasn't displaying critical report information (such as the Entity info) due to Select-Object being hardcoded. Function has been updated to parse the resulting Parameters and Entity info out to the top-level object.
  * Added: `Flat` switch to specify that the parsed properties match what GAM returns, i.e. `'gmail:num_outbound_unencrypted_emails' = 6`. Normal behavior would be to parse that into an ordered dictionary, i.e. `gmail['num_outbound_unencrypted_emails'] = 6`, so that only `gmail` is seen from the top level object and all relevant report data is captured in the underlying dictionary.
  * Added: `Raw` switch to allow the raw UsageReportsValue to be returned instead of parsing it out.

## 2.23.0

* [Issue #152](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/152)
  * Added full coverage of `Gmail.Settings.SendAs` resource (where signatures are managed with the newer Gmail API):
    * Added: `Get-GSGmailSendAsAlias`
    * Added: `Update-GSGmailSendAsAlias`
    * Added: `Get-GSGmailSignature` (aliased to `Get-GSGmailSendAsAlias`)
    * Added: `Update-GSGmailSignature` (aliased to `Update-GSGmailSendAsAlias` with some additional convenience parameters)
    * Added: `Get-GSGmailSendAsSettings` (aliased to `Get-GSGmailSendAsAlias`)
    * Added: `Update-GSGmailSendAsSettings` (aliased to `Update-GSGmailSendAsAlias`)
    * Added: `Remove-GSGmailSendAsAlias`
    * Added: `New-GSGmailSendAsAlias`
    * Added: `Send-GSGmailSendAsConfirmation`

## 2.22.4

* [Issue #147](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/147)
  * Added: `Get-GSChromeOSDevice` - Handles Get or List requests, depending on if you specify a ResourceId or not.
  * Added: `Update-GSChromeOSDevice` - Handles Action, Move and/or Patch requests depending on the parameters passed.

## 2.22.3

* [Issue #144](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/144)
  * Updated: `Start-GSDriveFileUpload` to not call `[System.Console]::CursorVisible` when `$Host` is PowerShell ISE

## 2.22.2

* [Issue #144](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/144)
  * Updated: `Start-GSDriveFileUpload` to `Dispose()` open streams once uploads are completed.
  * Added: `Stop-GSDriveFileUpload` to enable cleanup of any remaining open streams.
  * Updated: `Get-GSDriveFileUpload` to `Dispose()` any completed streams that are still open.

## 2.22.1

* [PR #141](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/141) - _Thanks, [@dwrusse](https://github.com/dwrusse)!_
  * Added: `Remove-GSDriveFile`
  * Updated: `Get-GSCalendarSubscription` to add support for `List()` requests and added the `ShowHidden` & `ShowDeleted` parameters.

## 2.22.0

* Miscellaneous: _Config management and portability updates_
  * Added: `Export-PSGSuiteConfig` function to export key parts of your config in a transportable JSON file.
  * Added: `Import-PSGSuiteConfig` function to import a config from a JSON file (i.e. one created with `Export-PSGSuiteConfig`) or from a JSON string (i.e. stored in a secure variable in a CI/CD system.)
  * Updated: All config functions now store the P12Key or the ClientSecrets JSON string in the encrypted config directly. This is to allow removal of the secrets files as well as enable PSGSuite to run in a contained environment via importing the config from a secure JSON string.
  * Updated: `[Get|Set|Switch]-PSGSuiteConfig` to include the P12Key and ClientSecrets parameters that enable housing of the key/secret directly on the encrypted config.
  * Updated: If the global PSGSuite variable `$global:PSGSuite` exists during module import, it will default to using that as it's configuration, otherwise it will import the default config if set.

## 2.21.3

* [Issue #131](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/131)
  * Fixed: Changed `CodeReceiver` to use `PromptCodeReceiver` when client is PowerShell Core, as `LocalServerCodeReceiver` does not appear to redirect correctly and auth fails. Same behavior in Core regardless of OS.
* Miscellaneous
  * Added: `OutputType` to all functions that return standard objects.

## 2.21.2

* [Issue #136](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/136)
  * Fixed: `Start-GSDriveFileUpload` failing when specifying a user other than the Admin user to do the upload as.

## 2.21.1

* [Issue #131](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/131) - _Free/standard Google Account support_
  * Fixed: Handling of scopes in `New-GoogleService` for authentication when a client_secrets.json file is used instead of the typical .p12 key.
  * Updated: Documentation to show how to use an account that is not a G Suite admin or G Suite user at all with PSGSuite
  * Updated: `*-PSGSuiteConfig` commands now store the client_secrets.json string contents directly on the encrypted config once provided either the path or the string contents directly, allowing users to remove any plain text credentials once loaded into the encrypted config.
  * Updated: `Get-GSToken` now uses `New-GoogleService` under the hood, so `client_secrets.json` will work with Contacts API.

## 2.21.0

* [PR #130](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/130) / [Issue #129](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/129)
  * Added: Support for UserRelations management in `New-GSUser -Relations $relations` and `Update-GSUser -Relations $relations` via `Add-GSUserRelation` helper function. - _Thanks, [@mattwoolnough](https://github.com/mattwoolnough)!_
  * Added: Logic to `Update-GSUser` to enable clearing of all values for user properties `Phones`, `ExternalIds`, `Organizations`, and `Relations` by REST API call via passing `$null` as the value when calling `Update-GSUser`. - _Thanks, [@mattwoolnough](https://github.com/mattwoolnough)!_
* [Issue #129](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/129)
  * Fixed: Documentation for `Get-GSSheetInfo` around the `Fields` parameter.

* [Issue #115](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/115)
  * Renamed: `Get-GSCalendarEventList` to `Get-GSCalendarEvent` and set the original name as an exported Alias to the new name for backwards compatibility.
  * Added: `EventId` parameter to `Get-GSCalendarEvent` to specify individual event ID's to get instead of a filtered list.
  * Added: `PrivateExtendedProperty` parameter to `Get-GSCalendarEvent`.
  * Added: `SharedExtendedProperty` parameter to `Get-GSCalendarEvent`.

  * Cleaned up `State` parameter on `Get-GSStudentGuardianInvitation` to validate against the Enum directly in an effort to prevent the same issue as item 2

## 2.14.0

* [Issue #85](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/85)

    * `New-GSStudentGuardianInvitation`
    * `Remove-GSCourse`
    * `Remove-GSCourseAlias`
    * `Remove-GSCourseInvitation`
    * `Remove-GSCourseParticipant`
    * `Remove-GSStudentGuardian`
    * `Update-GSCourse`
* Fixed: `Get-GSToken` Create/Expiry time split issue on macOS caused by difference in `-UFormat %s` (macOS doesn't have trailing milliseconds)
* Fixed: Logic in confirming if UserID is `[decimal]` to prevent unnecessary errors

## 2.13.2

* [Issue #83](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/83)
  * Added: `Add-GSUserOrganization` to create UserOrganization objects
  * Updated: `Update-GSUser` and `New-GSUser` to include Organizations parameter and cleaned up logic for other Generic.List type parameters to ensure functionality

## 2.13.1

* Fixed: `Add-GSDrivePermission` fails to transfer ownership of files ([Issue #80](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/80))

## 2.13.0

* Fixed: Private list functions to check if a value is actually returned before adding members to the returned objects ([Issue #77](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/77))
* Added: `Update-GSChatMessage` to allow updating existing messages in Chat (i.e. on Card Clicked events)
* Updated: Order of parameters in `Get-GSToken` to place `Scopes` first, as it's the only required parameter
* Updated: `Get-GSChatSpace` now updates the config with Space names/shortnames for ease of use
* Updated: `Send-GSChatMessage` to also support calling the REST API as an additional option. This is necessary for PoshBot due to the deserialization of objects passed back to result parser breaking the Google SDK type references
* Updated: `Get-GSChatConfig` to always fetch the latest config if no ConfigName is passed instead of using `Show-PSGSuiteConfig`
* Updated: `Set-PSGSuiteConfig` to refresh the Spaces dictionary each time in order to remove stale spaces (i.e. on removal of bot from a Room or DM)
* Fixed: `Add-GSChatOnClick` now properly builds the hashtable for the Webhook object
* Updated: `Get-GSUser` to allow passing User ID's instead of emails by checking if value passed is a `decimal` before concatenating the domain name.

## 2.12.1

* Fixed: `Get-GSDrivePermission` now returns all fields (including EmailAddress)

## 2.12.0

* Added: `Get-GSChatMember`, `Get-GSChatMessage`, `Get-GSChatSpace`, `Remove-GSChatMessage`, `Send-GSChatMessage`, `Add-GSChatButton`, `Add-GSChatCard`, `Add-GSChatCardAction`, `Add-GSChatCardSection`, `Add-GSChatImage`, `Add-GSChatKeyValue`, `Add-GSChatOnClick`, `Add-GSChatTextParagraph`
  * These allow interaction with the Google Chat API via either Webhook or through the SDK
  * Using the Webhook requires no additional configuration as the Webhook includes the authentication key and token in the URL
  * Using the SDK requires additional configuration of the Bot in the Google Developer's console (Documentation soon to come)

### New Functionality

* PowerShell Core/cross-platform support added

* Get-GSGmailMessage can now save message attachments to a local path
* File uploads to Drive are now supported (including recursive folder uploads!)
* P12 Keys (service accounts) _and_ client_secrets.json (OAuth) are both now supported

### Breaking Changes in 2.0.0

#### Gmail Delegation Management Removed

~~The Gmail API does not yet support handling inbox delegation. The functionality addition has been pushed back again until Q3 of 2018. Once the Gmail API supports inbox delegation, those functions will be added.~~

**Delegation functions have been re-added to PSGSuite as of v2.4.0! Update now to get all the goodness of v2 + delegation commands!**

#### Functions Removed

Please note that not all functions were ported to PSGSuite 2.0.0 due to restrictions within the .NET SDK and deprecated API calls. Here is the list of functions no longer existing in PSGSuite as of 2.0.0:

* Get-GSToken: no need for this as the keys are being consumed by Googles Auth SDK directly now, which makes Access/Refresh tokens non-existent for P12 Key service accounts and token management is handled automatically
* Revoke-GSToken: same here, no longer needed due to auth service changes
* Start-PSGSuiteConfigWizard: no longer supported as WPF is not compatible outside of Windows


#### Functions Aliased

All other functions are either intact or have an alias included to support backwards compatibility in scripts. Full list of aliases:
