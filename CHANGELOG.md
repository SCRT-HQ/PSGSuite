# PSGSuite - ChangeLog

## 2.36.5 - 2020-11-01

* [Issue #331](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/331)
    * Updated many inaccurate parameters in `Set-GSGroupSettings.ps1` due to Google Group changes upstream

## 2.36.4 - 2020-03-20

* [Issue #270](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/270)
    * Corrected inaccurate warning that no licenses were found for a user when using the `CheckAll` switch on `Get-GSUserLicense`.

## 2.36.3 - 2020-03-20

* [Issue #270](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/270)
    * Added `CheckAll` switch parameter to `Get-GSUserLicense`
    * Updated `User` parameter aliases for all `*-GSUserLicense` functions to include `UserId` for better pipeline support.
* Miscellaneous
    * Updated GitHub Release section in psake.ps1 to POST the release to the Org URL due to failures.

## 2.36.2 - 2020-03-02

* [Issue #263](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/263)
    * Cleaned up decryption logic for encrypted config.

## 2.36.1 - 2020-03-02

* [Issue #263](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/263)
    * Fixed `[SecureString]` decryption on Unix machines running PowerShell 7 (found additional bugs)
    * Migrated private `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` to `EncryptionHelpers.ps1` in the Private folder to allow a single place to update.

## 2.36.0 - 2020-02-28

* [PR #255](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/255) - _Thanks, [@FISHMANPET](https://github.com/FISHMANPET)!_
    * Added support for `[ScriptBlock]` values on the config, allowing you to provide a script to run that will pull in a configuration value (vs embedded the value directly on the config)
* [PR #255](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/260) - _Thanks, [@vaskotoo](https://github.com/vaskotoo)!_
    * Added support for an array of Users on `Get-GSGmailMessageList`
* [PR #261](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/261) - _Thanks, [@Foggy2](https://github.com/Foggy2)!_
    * Added support for all license types including undocumented ones.
    * Closed out [Issue #252](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/252) as well.
* [PR #262](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/262) - _Thanks, [@nwls-hermesj](https://github.com/nwls-hermesj)!_
    * Added support for pipeline input of Drive file objects to `Remove-GSDriveFile`.
* [Issue #256](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/256)
    * Cleaned up docs on `Send-GSChatMessage`.
* [Issue #258](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/258)
    * Removed URL Shortener functions due to Google deprecation.
* [Issue #263](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/263)
    * Fixed `[SecureString]` decryption on Unix machines running PowerShell 7
* Miscellaneous
    * Removed the Tasks API functions. Google has not pushed an update to the Tasks .NET SDK in over 2 months, so it is now behind the current release versions of the core Google.Apis assemblies, resulting in failure to import.

## 2.35.1 - 2019-12-29

* [Issue #57](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/57)
    * Updated `New-GSGmailSMIMEInfo` to cast `Pkcs12` to URLSafeBase64 *without* removing the trailing padding `=`, based on GAMs process in Python. Confirmed replication of the resultant value being sent from GAM in PowerShell, ready to validate.

## 2.35.0 - 2019-12-29

* [Issue #216](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/216) - _Thank you, [@WJurecki](https://github.com/WJurecki)!_
    * Added `Add-GSSheetValues` to use the native `Append()` method instead of `BatchUpdate()` to prevent needing to calculate the last row like you do with `Export-GSSheet`. Since the input for this method has additional options and the output differs from what `Export-GSSheet` outputs, this has been moved to a unique function to prevent introducing breaking changes to `Export-GSSheet`.
* [Issue #221](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/221)
    * Added: `Invoke-GSUserOffboarding` function to wrap common offboarding tasks for ease of access management automation.
* [Issue #248](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/248)
    * Fixed `Get-GSSheetInfo` so it no longer defaults `-IncludeGridData` to `$true` if not specified in `$PSBoundParameters`.
* [Issue #249](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/249)
    * Updated private function `Resolve-Email` with new `IsGroup` switch, then cleaned up all `*-GSGroup*` functions to use it so that Group ID's are respected based on RegEx match.
* [Issue #252](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/252)
    * Added: `Archived` parameter to `Update-GSUser` to enable setting of Archived User licenses.
* Miscellaneous
    * Swapped instances of `Get-StoragePath` for `Get-ConfigurationPath` in `Import-SpecificConfiguration` and `Set-PSGSuiteConfig` to avoid alias related issues with PowerShell 4.0

## 2.34.0 - 2019-11-02

* [Issue #245](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/245) + [PR #246](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/246) - _Thank you, [@devblackops](https://github.com/devblackops)!_
    * Added: Optional `-CreateMeetEvent` switch parameter to `New-GSCalendarEvent` to create a Google Meet conference and attach it to the calendar event.

## 2.33.2 - 2019-10-06

* [Issue #242](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/242)
    * Fixed: Error handling around `[System.Console]::CursorVisible` on `Start-GSDriveFileUpload`, `Wait-GSDriveFileUpload` and `Write-InlineProgress`
    * Cleaned up verbose handling on `Stop-GSDriveFileUpload` due to file uploads showing as Failed even though they were successful.
* Miscellaneous
    * Updated build.ps1 script for better verbose output

## 2.33.1 - 2019-10-06

* [Issue #235](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/235)
    * Removed: `Name` parameter from `Start-GSDriveFileUpload` as it was unused in the function and doesnt make sense when uploading an array of files.
* [Issue #238](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/238)
    * Added: `Get-GSDataTransfer` to Get/List current Data Transfers
* [Issue #239](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/239)
    * Removed: `Update-GSResource` `Id` parameter as it was non-applicable (duplicate of `ResourceId` and not writable per API docs)
    * Cleaned up function help and examples to match changes
* [Issue #240](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/240)
    * Fixed: `Get-GSCalendar` now properly resolves single calendar metadata retrieval and passes List requests to `Get-GSCalendarSubscription` since the `Calendars` service does not support List requests.
* Miscellaneous
    * Updated Google .NET SDKs to latest versions
    * Cleaned up build.ps1 script

## 2.33.0 - 2019-09-26

* [Issue #236](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/236)
    * Fixed: Custom converter for Configuration metadata defaults to `ConvertTo-SecureString` as the preferred function instead of the custom `Secure`. `Secure` is still supported for backwards compatibility.

## 2.32.3 - 2019-09-18

* [Issue #234](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/234)
    * Fixed: `Update-GSUserPhoto` errors by switching to `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($path)`.

## 2.32.2 - 2019-09-15

* [Issue #225](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/225)
    * Fixed: NuGet package versions for Google APIs fell back to the version sheet during the most recent version push due to failure to communicate with NuGet to dynamically pull the latest version, resulting in previous enhancements now failing (e.g. Admin SDK rolled back to a 2017 version).
        * Added more guards and force update situations for the NuGetDependencies.json file during local builds to more concretely guarantee that the NuGet packages needed will be available.

## 2.32.1 - 2019-09-14

* [Issue #232](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/232)
    * Added: `Visibility` parameter on `New-GSCalendarEvent`

## 2.32.0 - 2019-09-12

* [Issue #229](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/229)
    * Added: `Update-GSGmailLanguageSettings` and `Get-GSGmailLanguageSettings` functions to update/get a users default language settings in Gmail.
* [Issue #231](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/231)
    * Added: `Update-GSCalenderSubscription` function to updated existing calendar subscriptions.
    * Removed: Default values for the following parameters on `Add-GSCalendarSubscription` to prevent automatically adding notifications for new CalendarList entries (subscriptions):
        * `DefaultNotificationType`
        * `DefaultNotificationMethod`
        * `DefaultReminderMethod`
        * `DefaultReminderMinutes`
    * Added: `Notifications` and `Reminders` parameters to `Add-GSCalenderSubscription` and `Update-GSCalenderSubscription`
    * Added: `Reminders` parameter to `New-GSCalendarEvent` and `Update-GSCalendarEvent` functions to set custom reminders on calendar events.
    * Added: `Add-GSCalendarEventReminder` and `Add-GSCalendarNotification` helper functions.
    * Updated: `DisableReminder` switch parameter name on `New-GSCalendarEvent` and `Update-GSCalendarEvent` functions to `DisableDefaultReminder` to better align with what that actually effects (default reminder inheritance only, not reminder overrides). The previous parameter name has been set as an alias to maintain backwards compatibility.
    * Added: `RemoveAllReminders` parameter to `Update-GSCalendarEvent` to remove all custom reminders and disable calendar inheritance.
* [Issue #232](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/232)
    * Added: `Visibility` parameter on `Update-GSCalendarEvent` to set the visibility of a calendar event.
* Miscellaneous
    * Forced `Type` parameter values to lower on the `Add-GSUser*` helper functions to ensure case senstive field matches whats expected.
    * Updated Google .NET SDKs to latest versions.
    * Updated and corrected a LOT of comment based function help.
    * Added function help tests to validate that functions contain expected help content.

## 2.31.1 - 2019-08-30

* [Issue #222](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/222)
    * Fixed: `Remove-GSUserASP` and `Remove-GSUserToken` not removing all when no Id is passed due to no service being created.
* [Issue #225](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/225)
    * Added: `RecoveryEmail` and `RecoveryPhone` parameters to `Update-GSUser`
* [Issue #189](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/189)
    * Removed `$env:UserName` from the application name when creating the client in `New-GoogleService` to prevent errors with the underlying .NET SDK.
* Miscellaneous
    * Fixed: Corrected logic on the `FullName` parameter on `Update-GSUser` to parse the name parts.
    * Updated Google .NET SDKs to latest versions.

    * Added:
        * `Get-GSDomain`
        * `Remove-GSDomain`
        * `New-GSDomain`
        * `Get-GSDomainAlias`
        * `New-GSDomainAlias`
        * `Remove-GSDomainAlias`
    * _These will need the additional scope of `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.domain` added in order to use!_
* Miscellaneous
    * Added:
        * `Get-GSCustomer`
        * `Update-GSCustomer`
        * `Add-GSCustomerPostalAddress`
    * _These will need the additional scope of `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.customer` added in order to use!_

## 2.30.2

* [Issue #212](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/212)
    * Fixed: `Get-GSUserLicense` no longer short circuiting after first license match when processing pipeline input
    * Updated: License SKU order to check most common license types first for `Get-GSUserLicense`, which should result in faster overall processing when working with a large amount of users.

## 2.30.1

* Miscellaneous
    * Fixed: `Remove-GSDrivePermission` duplicate parameter alias prevented usage after module update.

## 2.30.0

* [Issue #193](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/193)

    * Added: Support for inline image downloading with `Get-GSGmailMessage` where the image is not included on the Attachments property of the parsed message object.
    * Fixed: `Get-GSGmailMessage` will now automatically set the `Format` to `Raw` if either `ParseMessage` or `SaveAttachmentsTo` is passed, as `ParseMessage` is a requirement in order to be able to access the message attachments as needed.
* [Issue #204](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/204)
    * Added: `Recurse` parameter to `Get-GSDriveFileList` to allow recursively listing all files and subfolders underneath the result set. Confirmed setting the `Limit` parameter also works as expected with `Recurse` included, stopping is the original limit is reached.
    * Added: `Get-GSDriveFolderSize` function to return the calculated total size of the files in the specified folder(s).
* Miscellaneous
    * Added: `Rfc822MsgId` parameter to `Get-GSGmailMessageList` to easily build a query looking for a specific RFS 822 Message ID.

    * Added: `Show-GSDrive`
* [Issue #184](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/184)
    * Added: `EnableCollaborativeInbox` parameter to `Update-GSGroupSettings`
    * Added: `WhoCanDiscoverGroup` parameter to `Update-GSGroupSettings`

## 2.28.2

* [Issue #194](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/194)
    * Fixed: Parameters not setting correctyl on `Update-GSChromeOSDevice`:
        * `AnnotatedAssetId [string]`

    * Added: Parameters to `Update-GSDriveFile`:
        * `CopyRequiresWriterPermission [switch]`
        * `Starred [switch]`
        * `Trashed [switch]`
        * `WritersCanShare [switch]`
* [Issue #194](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/194)
    * Added: Parameters to `Update-GSChromeOSDevice`:
        * `AnnotatedAssetId [string]`
        * `AnnotatedLocation [string]`

    * Replaced: `SupportsTeamDrives = $true` with `SupportsAllDrives = $true` on all functions that have it.
* Miscellaneous
    * Fixed: `Export-PSGSuiteConfig` is faster due to safely assuming that the P12Key and/or ClientSecrets values have already been pulled from the corresponding keys.
    * Fixed: Incomplete documentation for `Test-GSGroupMembership`.
    * Added: `UseDomainAdminAccess` switch parameter to `Get-GSTeamDrive`
    * Removed: `Get-GSUserLicenseListPrivate` by rolling the `List` code into `Get-GSUserLicense`

## 2.25.0

* [Issue #162](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/162)
    * Updated: `New-GoogleService` now caches Service objects created during the current session. This means that repeated calls will attempt to use an existing Service object from the cache if present, otherwise it will create the Service as usual.
    * Updated: `New-GoogleService` Verbose output. To cut down on verbose noisiness, the following verbose output is set:
        * New Service created = `Building ServiceAccountCredential from....`
        * First use of existing Service = `Using matching cached service for user....`
        * Re-use of existing Service = No verbose output (helps cut down on pipeline verbosity where service re-use is expected)

    * Added: `Revoke-GSStudentGuardianInvitation` to revoke student guardian invitations (Classroom API)

## 2.23.2

* Fixed logic issue with Get-GSUsageReport for reports returning no entities where errors would be thrown. Resolved by guarding against acting on `$null` values in the loop.

## 2.23.1

**This update changes the output of `Get-GSUsageReport` -- please review the output changes before updating if you have scripts that use that function!!**

* Fixed: `Get-GSUsageReport` wasn't displaying critical report information (such as the Entity info) due to Select-Object being hardcoded. Function has been updated to parse the resulting Parameters and Entity info out to the top-level object.
    * Added: `Flat` switch to specify that the parsed properties match what GAM returns, i.e. `'gmail:num_outbound_unencrypted_emails' = 6`. Normal behavior would be to parse that into an ordered dictionary, i.e. `gmail['num_outbound_unencrypted_emails'] = 6`, so that only `gmail` is seen from the top level object and all relevant report data is captured in the underlying dictionary.
    * Added: `Raw` switch to allow the raw UsageReportsValue to be returned instead of parsing it out.

## 2.23.0

* [Issue #152](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/152)

        * Added: `Get-GSGmailSendAsSettings` (aliased to `Get-GSGmailSendAsAlias`)
        * Added: `Update-GSGmailSendAsSettings` (aliased to `Update-GSGmailSendAsAlias`)
        * Added: `Remove-GSGmailSendAsAlias`
        * Added: `New-GSGmailSendAsAlias`
        * Added: `Send-GSGmailSendAsConfirmation`

## 2.22.4

* [Issue #147](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/147)
    * Added: `Get-GSChromeOSDevice` - Handles Get or List requests, depending on if you specify a ResourceId or not.

## 2.22.0

* Miscellaneous: _Config management and portability updates_
    * Added: `Export-PSGSuiteConfig` function to export key parts of your config in a transportable JSON file.
    * Added: `Import-PSGSuiteConfig` function to import a config from a JSON file (i.e. one created with `Export-PSGSuiteConfig`) or from a JSON string (i.e. stored in a secure variable in a CI/CD system.)
    * Updated: All config functions now store the P12Key or the ClientSecrets JSON string in the encrypted config directly. This is to allow removal of the secrets files as well as enable PSGSuite to run in a contained environment via importing the config from a secure JSON string.
    * Updated: `[Get|Set|Switch]-PSGSuiteConfig` to include the P12Key and ClientSecrets parameters that enable housing of the key/secret directly on the encrypted config.
    * Updated: If the global PSGSuite variable `$global:PSGSuite` exists during module import, it will default to using that as it's configuration, otherwise it will import the default config if set.

## 2.21.3

* [Issue #131](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/131)
    * Fixed: Changed `CodeReceiver` to use `PromptCodeReceiver` when client is PowerShell Core, as `LocalServerCodeReceiver` does not appear to redirect correctly and auth fails. Same behavior in Core regardless of OS.

* [Issue #131](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/131) - _Free/standard Google Account support_
    * Fixed: Handling of scopes in `New-GoogleService` for authentication when a client_secrets.json file is used instead of the typical .p12 key.
    * Updated: Documentation to show how to use an account that is not a G Suite admin or G Suite user at all with PSGSuite
    * Updated: `*-PSGSuiteConfig` commands now store the client_secrets.json string contents directly on the encrypted config once provided either the path or the string contents directly, allowing users to remove any plain text credentials once loaded into the encrypted config.
    * Updated: `Get-GSToken` now uses `New-GoogleService` under the hood, so `client_secrets.json` will work with Contacts API.

## 2.21.0

* [PR #130](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/pull/130) / [Issue #129](https://github.com/scrthq/PSGSuite/issues/129)

* Updated: Order of parameters in `Get-GSToken` to place `Scopes` first, as it's the only required parameter
* Updated: `Get-GSChatSpace` now updates the config with Space names/shortnames for ease of use
* Updated: `Send-GSChatMessage` to also support calling the REST API as an additional option. This is necessary for PoshBot due to the deserialization of objects passed back to result parser breaking the Google SDK type references
* Updated: `Get-GSChatConfig` to always fetch the latest config if no ConfigName is passed instead of using `Show-PSGSuiteConfig`

* P12 Keys (service accounts) _and_ client_secrets.json (OAuth) are both now supported

### Breaking Changes in 2.0.0

#### Gmail Delegation Management Removed

~~The Gmail API does not yet support handling inbox delegation. The functionality addition has been pushed back again until Q3 of 2018. Once the Gmail API supports inbox delegation, those functions will be added.~~

**Delegation functions have been re-added to PSGSuite as of v2.4.0! Update now to get all the goodness of v2 + delegation commands!**

#### Functions Removed

Please note that not all functions were ported to PSGSuite 2.0.0 due to restrictions within the .NET SDK and deprecated API calls. Here is the list of functions no longer existing in PSGSuite as of 2.0.0:

* Get-GSToken: no need for this as the keys are being consumed by Googles Auth SDK directly now, which makes Access/Refresh tokens non-existent for P12 Key service accounts and token management is handled automatically
* Revoke-GSToken: same here, no longer needed due to auth service changes
* Start-PSGSuiteConfigWizard: no longer supported as WPF is not compatible outside of Windows


#### Functions Aliased

All other functions are either intact or have an alias included to support backwards compatibility in scripts. Full list of aliases:
